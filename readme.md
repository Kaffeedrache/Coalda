# Coalda

This is code for my diploma thesis "Analysis and Visualization of Coreference Features" published in 2010. Since then, there has not been any further work on this.


## Content

The folder "src" contains the Code of the Coalda software.

The folder "doc" contains the documentation of the code as created automatically by javadoc.

The folder "manual" contains an installation manual and a user guide for the software.

The folder "db" contains files for the creation of the database that is used by Coalda.

The folder "exampledata" contains some example data that can be imported to the database and used for visualization with Coalda. This data is a short excerpt of "Oliver Twist" written by Charles Dickens.

## Running Coalda

The software needs MatLab with the toolbox `somtoolbox` and a specific SOM Server written for it. This is not part of this repository as it was not my work in the thesis. If you are interested, contact me and we can sort it out.

For more information see the installation and user manual.
